Apart from typical [WordPress][wordpress], [Github Pages][github-pages] is another blogging option that supported by Github. In additional to regular static HTML content, it also supports static site generator [Jekyll][jekyll]. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page.

To start blogging with Github Pages, you could simply follow the steps mentioned in the [page][github-pages] to create a repository in [Github][github] and find out more information from it's [help][github-pages-help].

Once the repository is created, you could start blogging and customize the blog with your own favourite style. Or you could reference one of the themes [here][jekyll-themes] if you are a lazy guy like me. (You could easily find which one I am referencing! Thank you for the good work by [Amey Jaydiye][amey-jaydiey]!)

Happy bloggig now!!
